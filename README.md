# feedback
Usage-driven Software Engineering

## Proof of Concept

The feedback starts with easy ways to find a solution to a problem statement. It escalates the problem up to the point of opening a pull request and allow code changes by any user, not just developers.

- HTML custom element that displays a floating action button in any page or app
- Opens chat/search/command interface
- Search GitHub issues and discussions
- Search Git history
- Chat with maintainer
- Chat with other users
- Identify code location
- Open pull request
